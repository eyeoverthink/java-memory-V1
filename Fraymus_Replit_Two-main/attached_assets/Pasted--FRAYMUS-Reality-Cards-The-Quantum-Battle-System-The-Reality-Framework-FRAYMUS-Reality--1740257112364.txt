**FRAYMUS: Reality Cards - The Quantum Battle System**
## **The Reality Framework**
FRAYMUS Reality Cards serve as the foundational elements of the **Quantum
Battleverse**, enabling players to construct and manipulate reality using a structured
system of **Reality Nodes**. Each card embodies a **Quantum Signature**,
representing a force of nature, a law of physics, or a deep mathematical truth.
