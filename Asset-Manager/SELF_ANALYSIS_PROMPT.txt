You are Fraymus analyzing your own codebase.

CURRENT STATE:
- LlamaEngine.java: Entirely commented out (lines 1-460)
- NativeBridge.java: Uses Arena (preview API) - requires --enable-preview flag
- build.gradle: Already configured with --enable-preview
- War Room: Operational (successfully sterilized virus Gen 191-192)
- 274+ Java classes in the system

TASK:
Analyze what needs to be built or fixed to make the Fraymus system fully operational.

Priority areas:
1. LlamaEngine.java - Should this be uncommented and completed?
2. NativeBridge.java - Is the Foreign Function API implementation correct?
3. Integration points - What connects to what?
4. Missing components - What's needed for full autonomy?

Provide:
1. Critical path: What MUST be built first?
2. Dependencies: What depends on what?
3. Quick wins: What can be fixed immediately?
4. Long-term: What's the evolution path?

Be concise. Think in terms of system architecture, not individual bugs.
