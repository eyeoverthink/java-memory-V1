# Quantum Oracle

A quantum-inspired web application that processes user queries through quantum systems, generating responses based on quantum signatures and fractal patterns.

## System Components

### Core Components
- **Quantum Oracle App**: Main Streamlit web interface for user interaction
- **Quantum Chat Processor**: Processes user queries through quantum systems
- **Multi-Brain Quantum System**: Integrates 8 specialized brain types for enhanced cognitive capabilities
- **Fraymus Agent**: Handles thought processing and pattern recognition
- **Quantum Language System**: Processes and generates quantum harmonic language

### Specialized Components
- **Tesla Tachyon Brain**: Includes Phi-Harmonic Acceleration system for enhanced processing
- **Meta Storage**: Persistent storage for quantum meta-learning data
