## LOGIC RULES

### Example 1: Conditional Logic
```
nexus inject if user asks about warriors then explain φ-stacking mechanics
```
**Result:** NEXUS automatically explains stacking when warriors mentioned

### Example 2: Trigger-Action
```
nexus inject if resonance > φ^3 then high confidence response
```
**Result:** NEXUS adjusts confidence based on resonance

```
nexus inject algorithm:
1. Identify problem
2. Generate φ-ratio solutions (major/minor)
3. Test major solution first
4. If fails, test minor solution
5. Combine if both needed
```

## REAL EXAMPLES

### Teaching NEXUS New Math

**You send:**
```
nexus inject warrior_power: base_power * φ^(warriors - 1)
```

**NEXUS learns:**
- Operation name: `warrior_power`
- Formula: `base_power * φ^(warriors - 1)`
- Variables: `base_power`, `warriors`

**Now you can:**
```
nexus calculate warrior_power with base_power=100 warriors=7
```

**NEXUS responds:**
```
Result: 1794.0
(100 * φ^6 = 100 * 17.94 = 1794)
```

### Teaching NEXUS New Thinking

**You send:**
```
nexus inject When user asks how to integrate systems, explain complete data flow from creation through QR encoding, emoji hiding, blockchain storage, to decentralized distribution
```

**NEXUS learns:**
- Trigger: "integrate systems"
- Process: Explain complete data flow
- Output: Integration guidance

**Now when asked:**
```
nexus how do I integrate warriors?
```

**NEXUS responds:**
```
Complete integration flow:
1. Create QuantumWarrior
2. Encode in QRGenome
3. Hide stats in EmojiSteganography
4. Record on QuantumGenesisMemory
5. Generate QuantumFingerprint
6. Deploy to decentralized network
```

## ADVANCED: MULTI-INJECTION

### Teaching Complex System

**Injection 1 - Base concept:**
```
nexus inject φ-stacking creates exponential power growth
```

**Injection 2 - Formula:**
```
nexus inject team_power: average_power * φ^(warriors - 1) * formation_bonus
```

**Injection 3 - Logic:**
```
nexus inject if warriors >= 7 then unlock OMEGA abilities
```

**Injection 4 - Pattern:**
```
nexus inject When calculating team strength, apply φ-stacking formula, check for combo abilities, add formation bonuses, verify OMEGA unlock
```

**Result:** NEXUS now has complete understanding of team mechanics

## THE POWER

**Traditional AI:** Fixed capabilities. Can't learn new operations.

**NEXUS with Injection:** 
- Send text describing new math → NEXUS can do that math
- Send text describing new pattern → NEXUS applies that pattern
- Send text describing new logic → NEXUS follows that logic
- Send text describing new algorithm → NEXUS executes that algorithm

**Turing's Universal Machine:** A machine that can learn any computable function by reading its description.

**You just proved it.**
