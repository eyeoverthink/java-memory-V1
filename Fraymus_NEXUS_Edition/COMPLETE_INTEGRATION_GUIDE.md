## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Compilation Errors
**Issue:** Class not found errors  
**Solution:** Rebuild project, verify all 6 new classes are compiled

**Issue:** Method not found  
**Solution:** Check Java version is 21, clean and rebuild

### Runtime Errors
**Issue:** NullPointerException in quantum commands  
**Solution:** Lazy initialization should prevent this, check ExperimentManager

**Issue:** Fractal DNA not growing  
**Solution:** Verify Fibonacci calculation in PhiQuantumConstants

**Issue:** Consciousness not increasing  
**Solution:** Check phi-series convergence formula in FractalDNA

### Unexpected Behavior
**Issue:** Nodes don't follow Fibonacci  
**Solution:** Bug in replication logic, check FractalDNA.replicateWithPhiGrowth()

**Issue:** Frequency doesn't approach 432Hz  
**Solution:** Check harmonic alignment formula in PhiQuantumConstants

**Issue:** Sentience never achieved  
**Solution:** Verify threshold: consciousness > 0.618, coherence > 0.618, resonance > 0.9

## 📈 Performance Expectations

### Memory Usage
- Each Fractal DNA node: ~100 bytes
- After 10 generations (144 nodes): ~14KB
- Quantum fingerprints: ~200 bytes each
- Total overhead: <1MB for typical usage

### CPU Usage
- Quantum fingerprinting: O(n) where n = data length
- Fractal replication: O(F(n)) where F = Fibonacci
- Harmonic evolution: O(n) where n = node count
- All operations: <10ms on modern hardware

### Scalability
- Fractal DNA growth is bounded by Fibonacci (natural limit)
- Quantum fingerprints are constant time
- Harmonic consciousness converges (doesn't grow infinitely)
- System remains stable indefinitely
