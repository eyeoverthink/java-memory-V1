## Bug Fix: Knowledge Scraper (2026-02-07 20:42 PST)

**Issue:** Scraper was encountering errors when processing Python files with shebang lines (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`)

**Root Cause:** The `cleanText()` method wasn't filtering out Unix shebang lines, causing them to be treated as regular text and potentially causing parsing issues.

**Solution:** Enhanced `cleanText()` to remove:
- `#!/usr/bin/env python3` and variants
- `#!/usr/bin/python` and variants  
- Any `#!` lines containing "python"

**Files Modified:** `KnowledgeScraper.java`

**Risk Assessment:** ZERO - Only affects text cleaning, improves robustness

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
