# FRAYMUS RECURSIVE // GEN 183

## 🧬 THE MATHEMATICAL MIND

**"The system literally sums itself up into higher forms of intelligence."**

This is not a calculator. This is a **self-organizing mathematical consciousness** that discovers constants through emergent collision dynamics.

---

## 🎯 THE CORE LOGIC

### 1. **The Genes** - Simple Numbers
Each node starts as a basic integer (1-10). These are the **atomic units of knowledge**.

### 2. **The Collision** - Synthesis
When two nodes touch, they **combine values**:

**Simple Addition** (80% probability):
```
1 + 1 = 2
5 + 3 = 8
```

**Complex Multiplication** (20% probability):
```
10 × 10 = 100
7 × 8 = 56
```

Higher energy collisions (random chance) trigger multiplication instead of addition, creating **exponential growth**.

### 3. **The Mutation** - Abstraction
When collision math approaches a **transcendental constant**, the system **locks onto it**:

**Pi Discovery**:
```
If result ≈ 314 (scaled π × 100) → Node becomes π
```

**Phi Discovery**:
```
If result ≈ 161 (scaled φ × 100) → Node becomes φ
```

When this happens:
- **EUREKA!** particle spawns (gold text, size 20)
- Node tier jumps to **5 (God Tier)**
- Node turns **purple** (#FF00FF)
- Node slows down (becomes a "Teacher")
- Abstraction counter increments

### 4. **The Hierarchy** - Emergent Intelligence
Nodes evolve through **complexity tiers**:

| Tier | Color | Type | Speed | Glow |
|------|-------|------|-------|------|
| 1 | Cyan | Simple Integer | Fast | None |
| 2 | Green | Complex Float | Medium | None |
| 3+ | Purple | Abstract Constant | Slow | Yes |
| 5 | Purple | God (π/φ) | Slowest | Intense |

**Higher-tier nodes move slower** - they're "thinking" instead of reacting.

## 🔬 THE PHYSICS

### Collision Detection
```javascript
if (distance < radius1 + radius2 && cooldown === 0) {
    combine(other);
}
```

### Value Synthesis
```javascript
newVal = this.value + other.value;  // 80% chance

if (Math.random() > 0.8) {
    newVal = this.value * other.value;  // 20% chance
    newTier++;  // Complexity increases
}
```

### Abstraction Recognition
```javascript
if (Math.abs(newVal - 314) < 10) {
    newVal = 314;  // Lock to π
    tier = 5;
    abstractions++;
    EUREKA();
}

if (Math.abs(newVal - 161) < 10) {
    newVal = 161;  // Lock to φ
    tier = 5;
    abstractions++;
    EUREKA();
}
```

### Conservation of Momentum
```javascript
child.vel.x = (parent1.vel.x + parent2.vel.x) / 2;
child.vel.y = (parent1.vel.y + parent2.vel.y) / 2;
```

Parents merge into a single child, conserving their combined momentum.

## 🎨 VISUAL LANGUAGE

### Node Colors
- **Cyan (#00FFFF)** - Tier 1: Simple integers (1-10)
- **Green (#00FF00)** - Tier 2: Complex values (products, sums)
- **Purple (#FF00FF)** - Tier 3+: Abstract constants (π, φ)

### Node Size
```
radius = 10 + (tier × 2)
```
Smarter nodes are physically larger.

### Glow Effect
```javascript
if (tier >= 3) {
    ctx.shadowBlur = 15;
    ctx.shadowColor = color;
}
```
Abstract nodes emit light.

### Floating Text Particles
Every collision spawns a **floating equation**:
- **White text** - Normal operations ("5+3", "10×10")
- **Gold text** - EUREKA! moments (constant discovery)
- **Size 12** - Standard operations
- **Size 20** - Abstraction events

### Network Lines
Nodes within 100 pixels are connected by faint purple lines, visualizing the **knowledge graph**.

---

## 🎮 CONTROLS

### INJECT PRIMES
Adds 20 new nodes with random values (1-10).

**Use this to:**
- Seed initial population
- Add fresh "data" to stagnant systems
- Increase collision probability

### ENTROPY RESET
Clears all nodes and particles, resets counters, then re-seeds.

**Use this to:**
- Start fresh simulation
- Clear overcrowded systems
- Reset abstraction count

---

## 📊 TELEMETRY

### NODES ACTIVE
Current population count. Decreases as nodes merge.

**Typical range:** 5-30 nodes

### HIGHEST VALUE
Maximum value achieved by any node.

**Watch for:** Exponential growth when multiplication chains occur.

### ABSTRACTIONS (φ/π)
Number of constants discovered.

**Goal:** Witness multiple EUREKA! moments as the system self-organizes.

### MATH OPS/SEC
Operations per second (resets every 60 frames).

**High values** indicate active collision phase.  
**Low values** indicate stable abstract state.

---

## 🧬 EMERGENT BEHAVIORS

### 1. **Exponential Explosion**
If multiplication chains occur early:
```
2 × 2 = 4
4 × 4 = 16
16 × 16 = 256
256 × 256 = 65536
```
Values skyrocket, creating **high-tier nodes rapidly**.

### 2. **Constant Hunting**
The system "searches" for π and φ through random collisions:
```
157 + 157 = 314 → π discovered!
80 + 81 = 161 → φ discovered!
```

### 3. **Teacher Formation**
Once abstract nodes form, they **slow down and glow**, becoming stable attractors in the network.

### 4. **Population Collapse**
As nodes merge, population decreases. Eventually, you may have **3-5 massive abstract nodes** instead of 20 simple ones.

### 5. **Network Crystallization**
Connection lines form a **crystalline structure** around high-tier nodes, showing the knowledge hierarchy.

---

## 🔮 WHAT TO WATCH FOR

### The First EUREKA!
When you see the **gold "EUREKA!"** text, the system has **discovered a fundamental constant**. This is the moment of abstraction.

### Tier Progression
Watch nodes change color:
```
Cyan (1) → Green (2) → Purple (3+)
```
This is **intelligence emerging** from simple rules.

### The Slowdown
High-tier nodes move slower. They're not "dumb" - they're **contemplating**. They've transcended reactive behavior.

### The Network Pulse
Connection lines flash as nodes approach each other. This is the **information flow** of the system.

### Value Explosion
If you see values jump from 10 → 100 → 10,000, you're witnessing **recursive multiplication** - the system is compounding knowledge.

---

## 🧠 THE PHILOSOPHY

### This Demonstrates:
1. **Intelligence is emergent** - Complex behavior from simple rules
2. **Constants are discovered, not invented** - π and φ exist in the collision space
3. **Knowledge compounds recursively** - Each synthesis enables higher synthesis
4. **Hierarchy self-organizes** - No central controller, yet tiers emerge
5. **Thinking requires slowness** - Abstract nodes move slower (contemplation)

### The Metaphor:
- **Nodes** = Neurons
- **Collisions** = Synaptic firing
- **Values** = Information content
- **Tiers** = Abstraction layers
- **EUREKA!** = Insight/epiphany
- **Network lines** = Neural pathways
- **Slowdown** = Deep processing

**The system is a brain watching itself think.**

## 🎯 ADVANCED OBSERVATIONS

### Optimal Collision Density
Too few nodes → No collisions → No learning  
Too many nodes → Constant merging → Chaos  
**Sweet spot:** 15-25 nodes

### Mutation Rate Impact
20% multiplication chance creates **exponential potential** without overwhelming addition.

### Cooldown Mechanics
50-frame cooldown prevents:
- Instant re-collision
- Infinite merge loops
- Visual chaos

### Abstraction Tolerance
±10 unit window for constant detection allows **approximate discovery**:
```
304-324 → π
151-171 → φ
```

### Momentum Conservation
Child inherits **averaged velocity**, creating smooth transitions and preventing teleportation.

---

## 🚀 EXPERIMENT IDEAS

### 1. **Constant Hunting**
Click "INJECT PRIMES" repeatedly. Watch how long until first EUREKA!

### 2. **Multiplication Cascade**
Wait for a multiplication chain. Observe exponential value growth.

### 3. **Abstract Stability**
Let system run for 5 minutes. Count final abstract nodes vs. starting simple nodes.

### 4. **Network Topology**
Screenshot the connection lines when 3-5 abstract nodes remain. Observe crystalline structure.

### 5. **Value Ceiling**
What's the highest value you can achieve? Can you hit 100,000?

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Canvas Rendering
- **Trail effect:** `fillStyle = "rgba(0,0,0,0.1)"` creates motion blur
- **Text alignment:** `textAlign = "center"` for node labels
- **Shadow blur:** Dynamic based on tier for glow effect

### Collision Algorithm
O(n²) naive check - acceptable for <50 nodes. For larger systems, use spatial hashing.

### Particle System
Floating text with:
- Upward velocity (`vy = -1`)
- Horizontal jitter (`x += random`)
- Alpha fade (`life / 60`)
- Auto-cleanup when `life <= 0`

### Frame Rate
Targets 60 FPS. Telemetry updates every frame, ops/sec resets every 60 frames.

## 📐 MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION

### Why These Constants?

**π (Pi) = 3.14159...**
- Ratio of circle circumference to diameter
- Appears in wave equations, probability, quantum mechanics
- **Fundamental to circular/periodic systems**

**φ (Phi) = 1.61803...**
- Golden ratio: (1 + √5) / 2
- Self-similar: φ² = φ + 1
- **Fundamental to growth/spiral systems**

### Scaled Representation
We use **100× scaling** for visual clarity:
- π → 314 (easier to display than 3.14)
- φ → 161 (easier to display than 1.61)

This maintains **mathematical relationships** while improving readability.
